These are my projects for the STM32H747 discovery board

The board has stlink v3 built in, so you can get going with just a
USB cable (which also powers the board).  Stlink v3 also gives you
a serial console as a bonus, so no need for multiple cables and
gadgets.  Pretty nice.

My projects:

1. first - learn how to use openocd and examine flash (no code)
2. debug - simple experiments with openocd and my code
3. blink - what else?
4. serial - something like hello world maybe.
