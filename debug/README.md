Here it is!  My first code ever to run on the H747

I am using this in conjunction with openocd to do my
first basic programming on the H747.

I don't yet have clocks set up, nor can I blink an LED,
nor can I use the virtual console.  But using openocd
I can see my program modifying SRAM and that will
have to do me for now.  This has already answered
several questions and taught me some things.

Most of the details will be found in comments in
the source files.
